## Problem
   Create a table with 10 records and 4 columns. Each record has:
   1. Name: Full name (String)
   2. Role: one of Engineer, Sales, Customer Support, Manager (String)
   3. Connected On: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   4. Status: one of Screen, Scheduled, Explored, Hire (String). This is a dropdown list,
   and user can change status for each record

   There is a search input and a reset button. User can search in all columns to find
   specific records. User can do normal search "A B" or search with "and"/"or" such as: "A
   and B", "A or B". When "Reset" button is clicked, return the table before using search
   There is a statistic showing number of each status on the table:

   Requirements
   Use React JSX with Babel and Redux to build the table.
   Can use a boilerplate for initial setup with React, Webpack and Babel
   Can use any library or dependency
   Spent no more than 2 hours.

##To make Search just press Enter
